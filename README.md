# Plan of action:
1. Create repository on GitHub
2. Chose a mockup (https://cssauthor.com/resources/flat-mate-free-single-page-website-design-template-psd/)
3. Add contributors to the repo (to be added send your Github username in Slack to @serhiicss)
4. Start coding

### Guidelines:
1) Please use only pure HTML/CSS (no Bootsrap or any other frameworks).
2) Please try and document your work so it could be understood by all of team members (you can leave comments in code, write a separate article or even record a video :) ).
3) We are not going to use an actual slider or a video for this page, just a placeholder
4) Please comment end tags:
`<div class="foobar">lorem ipsum</div> <!-- foobar -->`
